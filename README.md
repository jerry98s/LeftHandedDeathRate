# LeftHandedDeathRate

This notebook explores the phenomenon of left-handedness and its potential impact on the average age at death. It refutes the claim that left-handed people die on average nine years earlier than right-handed people.

Using age distribution data, the notebook analyzes the changing rates of left-handedness over time. Researchers noticed that left-handedness rates decline from around 13% for people younger than 40 to about 5% by the age of 80. This decline is attributed to changing social acceptability rather than a factor of age itself.

The study uses death distribution data from 1999 and digitized rates of left-handedness from a 1992 paper to examine the apparent mean age of death for left-handed individuals. By using Bayesian statistics and pandas, the notebook aims to reproduce a difference in average age at death purely based on changing rates of left-handedness over time.

In conclusion, the notebook seeks to shed light on the relationship between left-handedness and age at death, demonstrating that the decline in left-handedness rates is not indicative of early death for left-handed individuals.
